# ðŸ§¬ AR Biology Flashcards App

## ðŸ“– Overview  
**AR Biology Flashcards** is an educational Unity app that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to display interactive 3D models of animal, fungi, plant, and bacterial cells. When a user scans an image target, the app shows related biology facts and allows users to take quizzes to reinforce learning.
